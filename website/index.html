            <p>The present project is a joint effort of partner universities, UTS from Sydney - Australia and HTW from Berlin - Germany, along with the client, ThoughtWorks.</p>
            <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a significant rise in remote working, resulting in a decline in the social interactions of employees, which is crucial for fostering a healthy workplace culture.
                To address this issue, <span class="text-random">Virtual Coffee Kitchen</span>, a product based on the concept of digital twins, has been developed specifically for modern-day remote employees.
                The device features a button that, when pressed, automatically creates a Zoom room and flashes a notification on the screens of all employees who have the device on their desk.
                This enables employees to engage in social interactions and casual conversations, similar to those they would have in the office kitchen.
                By eliminating the need to schedule meetings and manage notifications from various apps, this innovative and groundbreaking product is designed to enhance employee engagement and well-being in remote work settings.</p>

                    <p>One of the biggest challenges of remote work is staying in contact with colleagues. When people are physically present in an office, it is easy to have informal conversations with coworkers. However, with remote work, there is often a lack of spontaneous interaction and casual conversations.</p>

                    <p>The aim of the <span class="text-random">Virtual Coffee Kitchen</span> is to facilitate social interactions and maintain a sense of community among remote workers who are working from home.</p>
                    <p>The device provides a simple and hassle-free way for remote workers to engage in casual conversations or scheduled meetings, thereby eliminating the need for relying on digital communication tools, such as chat messages.</p>
                    <p>With this solution, ThoughtWorkers can now join a Zoom meeting by pressing a button on a portable device placed next to their workstation, allowing them to connect with colleagues easily.</p>
                    <p>The device is battery-operated and can be used at home or in the office with reconfigured Wi-Fi settings.</p>
                    <p>Upon joining a meeting, a non-disturbing screen flash notification is sent to other ThoughtWorkers, ensuring that they are aware of the meeting without causing any interruptions.</p>

                <p>The team has demonstrated unwavering commitment by working collaboratively in person during summer schools held both in Sydney and Berlin, as well as remotely via online channels.</p>
                <p>To streamline our project's management and ensure efficiency, we opted to employ the agile framework across all our sprints.</p>
